Descritpion
Have you ever talked to someone, but forgotten their name? Our project gives you the opportunity to make an instant connections with the people you meet expand your network. Voicedin is an app that allows to you to record your conversations with others and later view a transcription, key words used, sentiment value, and the linkedin account url of the identified speaker. Our app uses speech-recognition that provides people with an easy way connect with others on linkedin by identifying the speakers of the conversation and their linkedin account urls. The app also evaluates the overall sentiment value of the conversation for the user to view, and foster meaningful connections. 

 
Use Case
Our app would be very useful in conferences where one would meet hundreds of people and find meaningful connections. The user can start recording when s\he enters conference and visits booths and meets other people attending the conference. After that they don't have to worry about remembering all people with whom they want to connect later and continue their discussion, our app will suggest all other people's link s\he has talked with and also give transcript of their conversation so they can easily identify with whom they want to connect. We believe this would be really helpful for all people attending conferences, it can also be useful in career fairs.
